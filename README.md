Whether it’ a music festival, sporting event or any other  live event, surfacing great Twitter content in key moments is a powerful catalyst for engaging audiences and igniting conversations. Now we’re making it easier than ever to find and display the most relevant Twitter content with a new tool called SocialzR.

SocialzR was built to allow media publishers to search, filter and curate Twitter content that can then be displayed on jumbotrons at sports stadiums and concert venues. SocialzR enables publishers to create complex keyword and hashtag queries to easily uncover high quality Tweets. Queries can be further refined by location, languages and more to create of the most relevant Tweets pertaining to that topic. For example, you can find Tweets including #Iron Yard from  users within 15 miles of Saint Petersburg.

You can then simply drag and drop the most relevant tweets to your custom playlist. You can then use SocialzR to generate an RSS feed of your playlist, that can be used to display the best Tweets from that search on your broadcast graphics equipment like Ross Video's XPression or ChyronHego LyricPro. In addition this RSS feed could also be used in a widget on a website or mobile app.
